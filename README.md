## Hi!  I'm Juliana Akemi <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px" heigth="25px"> a Frontend Engineer from Brazil.

For the past 4+ years, I’ve been building web applications with React, JavaScript, TypeScript and Redux, from high-traffic airline websites, public servants administration to e-commerce platforms and enterprise systems. Along the way, I’ve also worked a lot with SASS, Material UI, REST APIs, state management and design systems.

I really enjoy taking a design from Figma and making it come alive in code, and I’m always excited about improving user experience, accessibility and performance.

My goal is to join an international team as a Frontend Developer (React) and keep growing while contributing to meaningful and impactful projects.
